      "In case you missed it, Graham Elliot Bowles told The Tribune his biggest pet peeve about diners is yelp. Here's the link: http://www.chicagotribun Well now I can see why. People might actually tell the truth! But I wasn't going to hold that against him. I mean a good restaurant is a good restaurant. I like food. And drinks. I just don't like paying through the nose for average food and horrible service. Here's a quick rundown on the food, in case you don't believe me and decide to eat there: Popcorn: I don't know. We didn't get any! This was the start of the joke of a dining experience we had at GE. It wasn't until we were mid-entree that we noticed people that walked in after us were given popcorn upon arrival. Then we remembered that annoying popping sound on the website and realized we'd been had! Chopin's Prelude cocktail: Nothing special. Had a pickled potato at the bottom, but that certainly didn't make or break it. If there was some sort of complex flavor combo, I didn't taste it. Considering they literally had someone's name with the title \"mixologist\" on the menu, you'd think they'd nail this shit all day. Oysters: Disgusting. After only a couple attempts at eating raw oysters, I've realized I simply can't do it without a bunch of horseradish and cocktail sauce, so this really isn't the fault of the restaurant. I guess I shouldn't have taken part in this order, but I heard something about champagne foam and got sold like an old shoe. Graham topped all 4 (srsly? $11 for 4 oysters?) with a different topping for each, so I only tried 2, but both should have been featured in the magazine Nasty Nast Traveler. Risotto app: Pretty good, but a very small portion. Had some sausage and fresh basil which was nice. It was topped with cheese, which I thought was kind of cheating. I mean, I could put cheese on cigarette butt and it would taste good. I'm actually messing around in the kitchen and making risotto for breakfast now btw. I'll let you know how it turns out later in the review. Crispy pheasant with foie gravy: This was the main course that all the servers seemed to rave about. I guess it's a play on chicken and waffles. The foie gras flavor in the small amount of gravy they gave me was all but absent. The pheasant was crispy and good, but really? This is the best you've got? This is a $16 entree priced at $35. After our entrees, we were so annoyed we decided to skip dessert. Just then we finally received our second round of cocktails that we'd ordered literally 25 minutes prior and had to ask for twice. I'll race anybody that thinks it takes half that amount of time to make a dirty martini. Our waiter was unapologetic as he delivered them just after our plates were cleared. We asked for the check, and he screwed that up too. More waiting. Now generally, as long as I'm getting what I order, my attitude can best be described as something along the lines of, \"I just don't give a fuck,\" but this was the worst service I've ever had at a restaurant. No joke. And when you're paying $80/person before tip, your expectations tend to raise a little. So I decided to do something I've never done before, I asked to speak to the manager. Pal, who claims to be the GM, introduced himself and handed us a business card with his name WRITTEN on it. Ok, first off dude, you're the GM of a nice restaurant charging exorbitant prices. Someone needs to pony up for some business cards with your name actually printed on them. We explained our horrible experience with our server to him, and rather than you know, doing anything about it or saying he'd talk to the waiter, he said something like, \"This is a very good restaurant, we hope to see you again soon for a better experience.\" What? So I said, \"Well at this point I have no plans to come back. We paid a lot of money and had a bad experience. Why would I come back?\" I was pretty mad at this point. I figured he'd hand me a gift certificate or something which I'd probably tear up on throw on the ground on or give to someone, but no. \"I'm sorry, and we'll look forward to seeing you again.\" Wow, Pal, if there were a customer service class, you would have aced it buddy. Next time I hear a restaurant is \"unassuming' or \"playful\" I'll know the English translation for that is \"classless ripoff\". This place should change it's name to Bowles Movement, because they treat you like shit. Anyway, enough about GE. Reliving the memory of last night is giving me diarrhea and hypertension. On to happier topics, like a risotto update. I just fucking rocked that. Mushrooms, bacon, egg whites, truffle salt, and cheddar. Yeah, I cheated too. PM for recipe info.\n",

      "Back in November, I told my boyfriend that I was going to take him out to dinner for his birthday and told him to think of an amazing place to go. He told me he wanted to go to Schwa. So I looked into it, and called for a reservation. In late November. In very early December they got back to me. And I missed the call. So I swore repeatedly, then called them back and left a message. They got back to me later that week saying they had an opening for two that very night. So I accepted and had a mini-stroke and then called my boyfriend to tell him to get hyped for some AMAZING food. So we got all giddy and starting thinking about the wines we were going to bring and what to wear and so on... And then Schwa called back, saying that the City of Chicago was going to be doing some work on or near the building and that their water was going to be shut off. Which, for those of you doing the math at home, meant that the whole restaurant had to be closed for the night. So the reservation we JUST MADE was null and void. The guys at Schwa were all kinds of apologetic about it and offered me the pick of the reservation litter: any day and time I wanted. So I went for a spot a week later, and broke the news to the boyfriend. A week later, I lost my job. The day after I lost my job, we were due to go to Schwa. Boyfriend told me to cancel the reservation and save my money and that we'll go when our finances are less tight. So I make the call and tell the boys at Schwa that they can give our spot away because I can no longer afford to eat there. They're sympathetic - and maybe a little moreso than the average schmuck on the street, because we've been playing phone tag for something like a month - and express their condolences. Five minutes later my phone rings. It's Schwa. They want us to come for dinner ANYWAY. And dinner is on them. We will be dining at the cost of FREE FIFTY-FREE. And then I cried. Because this kind of nonsense doesn't HAPPEN - not in real life, and certainly not to me. So we got ourselves prettied up and buy some wine, and headed on out to Wicker Park. And the gentlemen at Schwa were wonderful - personable, comfortable with the food (and they should be - the cooks are serving you and running the show there), and smartassed in a way you LIKE because it reminds you of your best friends who happen to be amazing chefs. (What? You don't have best friends like that? More's the pity, but you will FEEL like you have best friends like that while you're here.) And the food at Schwa was nothing short of AMAZING - the quail egg ravioli in brown butter with shaved white truffle, the veal heart with huckleberries, the apple pie soup, and the deconstructed PB&J dessert with black pepper ice cream were absolute standouts. I can't say enough good things about the food and it'll be a long damn time before I stop singing the praises of the chefs. We had an amazing night thanks entirely to the kindness and generosity of the gentlemen who run Schwa. Thank you, Schwa. Thank you so much. I want to send you cupcakes and hug all of you and you're all amazing, generous, wonderful people. Thank you.\n",

      "Back in November, I told my boyfriend that I was going to take him out to dinner for his birthday and told him to think of an amazing place to go. He told me he wanted to go to Schwa. So I looked into it, and called for a reservation. In late November. In very early December they got back to me. And I missed the call. So I swore repeatedly, then called them back and left a message. They got back to me later that week saying they had an opening for two that very night. So I accepted and had a mini-stroke and then called my boyfriend to tell him to get hyped for some AMAZING food. So we got all giddy and starting thinking about the wines we were going to bring and what to wear and so on... And then Schwa called back, saying that the City of Chicago was going to be doing some work on or near the building and that their water was going to be shut off. Which, for those of you doing the math at home, meant that the whole restaurant had to be closed for the night. So the reservation we JUST MADE was null and void. The guys at Schwa were all kinds of apologetic about it and offered me the pick of the reservation litter: any day and time I wanted. So I went for a spot a week later, and broke the news to the boyfriend. A week later, I lost my job. The day after I lost my job, we were due to go to Schwa. Boyfriend told me to cancel the reservation and save my money and that we'll go when our finances are less tight. So I make the call and tell the boys at Schwa that they can give our spot away because I can no longer afford to eat there. They're sympathetic - and maybe a little moreso than the average schmuck on the street, because we've been playing phone tag for something like a month - and express their condolences. Five minutes later my phone rings. It's Schwa. They want us to come for dinner ANYWAY. And dinner is on them. We will be dining at the cost of FREE FIFTY-FREE. And then I cried.

      "I love The Chicago Diner. I first came here about five years ago, and was especially impressed by a vegan mango shake, way before my vegetarian/veganish days. I've been coming ever since, having never been disapointed. The food is always great, service is friendly and likable, atmosphere is social and totally all-american, old school diner. The sweet potato quesillda, dagwood sandwich, mac n cheese, sweet potato fries, kale salad, karma burger, black bean burger, chicken cesar wrap, and beer/drink selection will knock your socks off. The Smores shake is the best damn milkshake/ smoothie/ice cream treat I've ever had in my damn life. Fathoming that it is vegan is almost bizarre, and hella good. I've ordered it the last 4 times I've been there (in the past 2 months) and the last time I upgraded to the larger size. Anyways, pay Chicago Diner a visit. Plz get a smores shake.\n",
